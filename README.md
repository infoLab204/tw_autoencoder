# tw_autoencoder: A restorable autoencoder model of observation-wise linearity with Python and R

Sunhee Kim, Chang-Yong Lee

tw_autoencoder represents Python and R scripts to assess the proposed auto-encoder model and to compare its performance with other models, such as stacked autoencoder (SAE),  principal component analysis (PCA), and independent componet analysis(ICA) by using MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN and CIRFAR10 data sets.


We proposed a restorable autoencoder model as a non-linear method for reducing dimensionality. The Python and R scripts provide the assessment of the proposed model and compare with other models in terms of the loss function, image reconstruction, and classification results. We provide Python and R scripts together in order for the readers to reproduce the results discussed in the manuscript.

### Install prerequisites:
* __R-packages__: ggplot2, gridExtra, caret, e1071, nnet, dplyr
* __Python__: tensorflow (version 2.2 or later), keras, numpy, matplotlib, datetime

### Loading the scripts: 
   copy the following Python module and R scripts from its GitHub repository
